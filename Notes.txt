Reduce:-(confusing topic it is not similar to the name)
It is generally used when we have to take all the array elements and
print a single value. example: greatest number in an array.

example:- sum of all the elements in an array
first without using reduce



using reduce function



Reduce function takes 2 arugument first one if function and second one is any initial value which we need to pass inside the accumulator.

example:- find the maximum value in the array



//using reduce function

More examples on MRF
 lets take example like data from API

const users = [
{firstName: "Kamal",lastName: "Hasan",age:60},
{firstName: "Donald",lastName: "Trump",age:60},
{firstName: "Rajini",lastName: "Kanth",age:70},
{firstName: "Ajith",lastName: "Kumar",age:40},
];

//List full names
const output = arr.map((x)=>x.firstName+" "+ x.lastName)



//finding ages example {60:2 , 70:1 , 40:1}

//Find out the firstname of all people who's age is less than 60
